00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.500
It doesn’t matter what websites you visit
or what apps you use

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Whether you’re shopping, sharing photos
or just sending messages

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.500
A lot of digital services all work
the same kind of way.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.500
That’s because most services are
made up of things called “design patterns”.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500
So what’s a design pattern?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
A design pattern is what you get when someone
solves a really common problem.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And they do it in a way that’s
easy for others to copy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500
That’s why you see the same things
pop up again and again.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Let me give you some examples.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.500
Say you’re searching for somewhere to eat.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
The search engine might ask you if
you want to share your location

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.500
to get more specific results.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.500
That’s a design pattern called
“just-in-time consent”.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.500
It’s called “just-in-time” because the service is
asking for permission to do something

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
right at the last possible second.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Here’s another example.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500
When you download a new app,
you often get a long list of questions

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.000
asking whether it can use your photos,
or your contacts, or share details about you.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.500
That’s called “upfront consent”.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.000
It’s a design pattern used to get
your permission to do specific things later on.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.500
Now, some design patterns have been around
for a very long time.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.500
Like Terms and Conditions.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.000
It can be impossible to know
what you’ve actually agreed to

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.500
when you accept.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500
That’s why we’re interested in
design patterns at IF.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.250
We think a lot of them are broken.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.000
A lot of services don’t feel very empowering.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That’s because the design patterns they use
don’t give us very much choice.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500
It’s all or nothing. You either agree
or disagree.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500
We don’t think that’s good enough.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.000
We think collecting and sharing new patterns
could change all of that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
Teams can see that there are actually
better ways to build services.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.500
Services that actually empower people.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.000

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The internet is full of patterns.
Let’s make them better.
