alt: A person's hand hovers their mobile phone over a bar code in an energy bill.

advantages:
 - It relies on someone having access to a specific address, limiting the risk it could be read by someone else
 - The code can be formatted for single use, so if it was used once  it could not be used again
 - The letter helps the user understand what the code is for and what information can be accessed by scanning it
 - It requires little effort from users to get access, making it quick and simple

limitations:
 - Letters can be lost, damaged and easily opened by others
 - Unless thereâ€™s secondary authentication after the code is scanned, anyone could access information
 - The user needs a  level of digital literacy to be able to scan a code with their device
 - Not all phones come with this capability
 - Some barcode scanner apps might require huge amounts of unnecessary permissions
