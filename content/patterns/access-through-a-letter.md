advantages:
 - Relies on someone having access to a specific address. This limits who will be able to read it
 - Codes can be single use, so it could only be used once
 - The letter helps someone understand what the code is for and what information can be accessed with it
 - It’s low friction as people don’t have to log in to access information

limitations:
 - Letters can be lost, damaged and easily opened by others living at the same address
 - Unless there’s secondary authentication after the code is scanned, anyone could access information
 - People need a level of digital literacy to scan a code with their device
 - Not all phones have this capability

Communicating information in a letter may mean people have more time to understand it. It also gives someone a physical record that they can keep and come back to. People should always be given a choice whether to receive information this way, depending on their household situation and their preference for paper communication.
