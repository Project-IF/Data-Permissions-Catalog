alt: The same security words are displayed on two different mobile phones.

advantages:
 - Users can quickly and easily identify if something is wrong with the end-to-end encryption
 - It’s a visible way of displaying security features, this may build confidence in situations where information is considered higher risk

limitations:
 - It might be difficult to explain what’s happening to users, which may have an impact on how effective it is as a signal
 - It requires users to manually check that the connection is secure every time, which may not be appropriate to the level of risk

examples:
  - title: Signal

    description: A previous version of Signal the app displayed two words on the caller’s home screens. This feature was removed in 2017.

In an end-to-end encrypted system, people can verify each other’s identity by saying a word generated by a cryptographic function. If the communication is compromised (through an impersonation attack, for example), the words won’t match.
