advantages:

 - A delay can be used to give users time to stop an emergency access if it is triggered by mistake

limitations:
 - It requires the user having someone they can trust who is available to help
 - It requires advance planning by the user and maintenance of the contacts list

Users nominate trusted individuals (like a family member or friend) to access data on their behalf if there’s an emergency. This pattern can also be used to restore access if a user can’t login to their account. For example, in the event of an accident, the trusted individual can take control of the user’s account.
