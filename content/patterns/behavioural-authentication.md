advantages:
 - It continuously verifies the users identity and access

limitations:
 - It won’t be effective if it’s used on a shared device
 - It can’t be used in isolation, it needs to be combined with other authentication methods

The identity of a user is continuously confirmed by their behavioural characteristics, like how they type or move the mouse. For example, if a device is stolen access will be revoked because the device will spot that a different person is using it, that shouldn’t have access.
