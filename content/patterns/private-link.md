A link is generated that can only be accessed by users with the right permissions. If someone without the right permissions clicks on the link, they are denied access. The link includes a long, random series of characters to make it hard to guess. For example, a Google Drive user can choose to set the permissions on a document so only people who work at the same company as them can view it.
