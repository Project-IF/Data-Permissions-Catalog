advantages:
 - A low friction way to build understanding about how decisions are made that doesnâ€™t require lots of knowledge from the user
 - Helps the user to test the output using different inputs before they commit

limitations:
 - Users might create their own theories for why outcomes change unless combined with other explanation methods

examples:

Users can try different data inputs to test  how this changes an automated decision before committing to the result. For example, when buying car insurance someone could test how selecting a different car would change the cost of their insurance before they purchase the policy.
