advantages:
 - Builds understanding about how decisions are made
 - Helps the user to test the output using different inputs before they commit

limitations:
 - Reveals outcomes rather than why a decision was made
 - Doesn’t guarantee understanding
 - Doesn’t give users’ power to influence the outcome

examples:

Users can try different data inputs to test  how this changes an automated decision before committing to the result. For example, when buying car insurance someone could test how selecting a different car would change the cost of their insurance before they purchase the policy.
