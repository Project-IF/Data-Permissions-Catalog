advantages:
 - Gives visibility of when data has been accessed, by whom and the reason why
 - It gives the user the ability to see whether their permissions are being followed

limitations:
 - Can be challenging to present the log in a way that makes it useful or actionable, depending on the granularity and frequency of recorded events
