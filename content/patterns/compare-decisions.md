title: Compare decisions
category: Explaining automated decisions
archived: false
future_pattern: true

advantages:
 - Users can see if a result is unusual and flag if something doesn’t seem right
 - Users can check and decide whether they think the result is fair
 - An organisation could monitor that decisions are consistent and fair over time

limitations:
 - If a user’s result is unusual there needs to be support to help them understand why
 - If there are lots of data points that contribute to different decisions it may be harder for users to compare them

examples:

Users can compare decisions based on similar data to better understand how those decisions are made. For example, in an automated insurance service, users could compare quotes from the same location.
