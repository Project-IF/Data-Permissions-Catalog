advantages:
 - Thereâ€™s virtually no friction for the user because they just continue using the service in the same way
 - It can reduce the risk of someone being able to use the account if they gain access to a currently logged in device

limitations:
 - If overused this pattern can be frustrating, requiring a user to actively prevent the session from expiring
 - Depending on implementation, this could make it harder for people with accessibility needs to use the service

Some products and services automatically expire active sessions after a specific time or using other signs of inactivity for added security.

For example, a smart watch might prevent the user from accessing private data or some features when the watch is taken off.
