alt: A dashboard for third-party access to an account (for example, a Google account). A third-party app called Scheduler can view, edit and remove entries in your calendar.

advantages:
  - People can still access a service with the help of someone they trust.
  - People get the value of combining multiple services in a new way.

limitations:
  - Easy to forget delegated permissions were set.
  - If permissions are broad they might lead to data being used in a way that people might not be aware of.

examples:

A person gives someone else, or third-party software, the authority to act on their behalf.

For example, giving an app permission to view, edit and remove entries in your Google calendar.
