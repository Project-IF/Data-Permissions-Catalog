advantages:
 - It could help users spot when automated decisions are based on less accurate predictions
 - It might help organisations identify areas where automated decisions may results based on less accurate predictions
 - It may help organisations to identify bias in automated decision making, or be more conscious of underrepresented groups in their data sets

limitations:
 - There are high barriers to using this - users may need very high digital literacy to understand the relationships between data, training datasets and machine learning.
 - Users may stop using the organisations service if they donâ€™t feel represented in the training data and confident in the automated decisions

Users can see the differences between data they generate and the data used for training a particular machine learning system. For example, a user is considering using an insurance company that used automation to calculate risk and generate quotes. They  can see whether the quote calculation is based on a dataset that learned using similar driving data as their own.
