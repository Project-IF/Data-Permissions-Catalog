 - Being open about input data is used in automated decisions demonstrates consistency and fairness to users
 - Seeing the data inputs lets users more easily spot and challenge an incorrect decision

 - Listing data types may be unhelpful or overwhelming if there are lots involved in a decision
 - Just listing data types may not give enough information to help users know how to get a different result
