advantages:
 - Preferences are set before using the service, allowing full functionality straight away

limitations:
 - In some cases, users won’t have enough information to make the decision. In this case might be useful to use [just-in-time consent]

alt: A list of data a service has permission to access.

examples:
  - title: Google Play Store
    description: before installing an app, a dialogue lays out the types of data and the phone features the app can access
  - title: Adding mobile device management (MDM) in MacOS
    description: When adding a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Profile in macOS the permissions necessary for performing remote management are presented up-front. Setting permissions up-front makes sense in this case as it’s not possible to seek consent when trying to remotely wipe a laptop which is lost or stolen.

Users are asked to set their permissions before they access or install a service. For example, when installing a messaging app the user might be asked to give access to their media files, their contacts or wifi connection information.
