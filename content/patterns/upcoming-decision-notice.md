advantages:
 - Gives users control and awareness over automated decisions
 - Low friction for the user, especially if it’s a regular decision or event. If everything’s ok it requires no action


limitations:
 - Relies on the user seeing the notification to be able to act on it
 - User needs to understand the reason for automated decision to decide whether to change it
 - Inappropriate if the decision is unexpected or higher risk, as the default is for the decision to go ahead

A user is notified about an upcoming decision, allowing them time to review, adjust or cancel it. For example, decisions might include automatically saving money or switching between mobile networks.
