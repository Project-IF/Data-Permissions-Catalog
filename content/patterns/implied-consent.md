A personâ€™s consent is assumed through their continued use of the service. They are often shown a message about this when starting to use a service.

Implied consent is an assumption of permission to do something that is inferred from an individual's actions rather than explicitly provided. For example, drivers are assumed to consent to blood alcohol testing.
