alt: The words not a robot is written in wavy text, the word not is written underneath in regular text.

advantages:
 - Reduces impact of automated access to systems, such as denial of service or spam
 - Modern detection mechanisms take place without challenges for the user to complete

limitations:
 - Computers are able to complete some challenges due to progress in machine learning or the feasibility of building click-farms
 - People using assistive technologies may be prevented from completing challenges
 - Large amounts of data are collected in order to build the engine for detecting automated access


examples:

Setting challenges that are quick for users to complete but hard to automate. This prevents automated access. For example, when filling in a survey a user has to complete a challenge before submitting their answers, like reading distorted text or identifying objects in a photo.
