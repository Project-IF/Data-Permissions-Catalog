advantages:
 - Users are able to verify the security of the conversations they have by checking the security codes are unchanged
 - Individuals don’t have equal risk profiles, checking security codes is an added burden but not necessarily one everyone would be concerned over.

limitations:
 - When codes change it’s necessary to verify through a separate channel (e.g. in person) that it’s for an expected reason such as getting a new phone.
 - Users must recognise the alert that security codes have changed, and understand why and what that means.

Many modern instant messaging applications make use of end-to-end encryption by associating public/private key pairs with individual devices. As users change devices by upgrading their phone, new key pairs are generated. This also happens if someone is targeted by an attacker attempting to impersonate them e.g. cloning their sim card. Users messaging people with newly associated devices are alerted that security codes have changed, meaning new keys are associated with the person they are messaging.
