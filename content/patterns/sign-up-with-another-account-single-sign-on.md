advantages:
 - Users can access a service without needing to remember another password
 - It’s a fast way to gain access to a new service
 - It can be more secure, as single sign-on providers tend to have more security resources to protect accounts
 - Users only need to trust the single sign-on provider with data about them

limitations:
 - Gaining access may be more difficult if the user isn’t able to access the other service
 - If the account with the single sign-on provider is compromised, the security of linked services is at risk
 - The user might not always be aware how the two services might be sharing data

examples:
 - title: When creating accounts in some online shops
 - title: Using work-issued Google account to sign up for time-tracking software Harvest

Allowing users to sign-up to a new service, through a service where they already have an account.

For example, the user can sign-up with their Google account to create a new account in a calendar app. In this scenario Google would be referred to as a single sign-on provider.
