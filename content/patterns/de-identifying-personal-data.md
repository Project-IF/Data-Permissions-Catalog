alt: A test tube labelled with a bar code.

advantages:
 - Data can be processed without revealing who it relates to

limitations:
 - Large collections of pseudo-anonymous data can be de-anonymised, making it possible to identify people. One way to address this is through differential privacy.

Personal data is de-identified to make it harder to trace it back to the individual, without the correct authorisation to re-identify the person. For example, a blood sample is labelled with a code, and the doctor can only work out who the blood came from by checking the code against a database.
