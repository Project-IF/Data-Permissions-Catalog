We’ve compiled this catalogue as a tool for teams building digital services.

It collects different patterns for a range of data sharing activities, from getting consent from users to asking for access to personal data and sharing data with third parties.

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Our aim is to:</p>

- Introduce people to the subject of data sharing
- Give product teams and organisations a shared language by giving patterns names
- Help product teams and organisations make better decisions to help empower people

You can improve the community’s shared knowledge by [contributing missing patterns](/contribute).

If you have feedback about the catalogue, then email [hello@projectsbyif.com](mailto:hello@projectsbyif.com).
